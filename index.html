                    <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado,
                        flood, hurricane or blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from
                        being prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the
                        immediate few days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.</p>

                        Worldwide, millions of houses are damaged or destroyed by disasters every year. People are
                        forced to leave their homes and seek refuge, sometimes for short time and sometimes for a
                        protracted period based on the nature of the disaster and the extent of the damage done to the
                        housing structures.</p>

                <p>Flooding is one of the most dangerous, destructive, and deadly natural disasters that can occur. They
                    can happen anywhere, and at any time, for a variety of reasons. Flood-related deaths are common,
                    usually due to lack of proper preparation and nonexistent safety protocols. As difficult as it may
                    be for adults to remain safe during a flood event, it is even more so for children.</p>

                blessing turned into bustle when the monsoon started in July. Heavy rainfall started throughout the
                country and flow of large-scale water leading to massive flooding situation in low lying areas of
                Northern, north-eastern and south-eastern districts. Now thousands of family is flood affected, lost
                their houses, livestock, struggling with contagious diseases waiting for support and relief.Tackling a
                natural disaster is a long time process because it takes a lot from the affected victims. They become
                helpless as their crops, livestock's, homes and everything gets affected. To help these people recover
                in long run, we look forward to your valuable support. Thank you!</p> <br>
